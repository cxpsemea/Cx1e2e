# This test is no longer reliable due to the removal of "system" as a valid requested engine type - using this engine previously caused a scan to run with no engine.
# The purpose of this test was to trigger a scan that does not run by using an unsupported or disabled engine type to test if it is marked as Failed or completes successfully.
# This can still possibly be achieved on a per-tenant basis by setting the "Engine" field to an unlicensed engine and setting ForceRun to true.
